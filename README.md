Hi, I’m KitCattok, you can refer to me however as Kit

Most of what I toss here will be private projects. In the future I intend to release some of my works to the public. In the meantime consider me an enthusiast of memory management and optimization. Don't question why I love C++ so much, or even x86 ASM, it just entices me. Either way, enough rambling, hopefully in the future you have a reason to show interest in my public releases.
